I am a forest ecologist interested in how to better manage our forests in a future characterized by global changes.  

My work aims at studying the dynamics of forest ecosystems to anticipate the potential impacts of climate, disturbance and socio-economic changes. I use simulation models of forest dynamics to explore interactions of trees with their changing environment and forest management strategies to enhance long-term resistance and resilience at multiple scales - from stand to landscape. I am passionate in dendrology, geography, silviculture, tree-ring research, forest inventory and the ecology of mixed forests. And I love mountains, cross-country skiing and home brewing. 

I am currently based in Montreal at the Centre for Forest Research of the [Université du Quebéc à Montreal UQAM](https://uqam.ca/). From June 2021 I will be based in South Tyrol, Italy, at the [Institute of Alpine Environment](https://www.eurac.edu/en/research/mountains/alpenv/Pages/default.aspx) at [Eurac Research](https://www.eurac.edu/). See the [project webpage](https://www.marco-mina.com/project/reinforce/) to know more. If interested, we have an [**open PhD position**](https://www.eurac.edu/en/aboutus/Jobs/Pages/PhD-student-in-Modelling,-management,-and-resilience-of-future-Alpine-forest-landscapes19052021.aspx) - deadline for applications June 30th.
