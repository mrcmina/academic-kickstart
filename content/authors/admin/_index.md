I am a forest ecologist at the [Institute for Alpine Environment](https://www.eurac.edu/en/research/mountains/alpenv/Pages/default.aspx) at [Eurac Research](https://www.eurac.edu/) in Bolzano/Bozen, Italy. 

I am interested in understanding how to better manage our forests in a future characterized by global changes. My work aims at studying the dynamics of forest ecosystems to anticipate the potential impacts of climate, disturbance and socio-economic changes. I am specialized in the application of simulation models of forest dynamics to explore interactions of trees with their changing environment and forest management strategies to enhance long-term resistance and resilience at multiple scales - from stand to landscape. I am also interested about dendrology, silviculture, dendroecological research, forest inventory and forest biodiversity. And I love mountains, geography, travelling, biking, cross-country skiing and home brewing. 

See the [REINFORCE project webpage](https://www.marco-mina.com/project/reinforce/) to know more about my current research.
