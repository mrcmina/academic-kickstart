## Project overview
**Integrating Species Mixtures in Tree Growth Functions for Forest Development Models in Switzerland (Swiss-SpeMixMod)**

The interest for **mixed-species forests** has been rising during the past years. There is a broad consensus that forests with higher species diversity are likely to be more adaptable to climate change, resilient to disturbances and provider of a higher level of ecosystem services. Although several studies showed that under certain conditions mixed-species forests can be more productive than single-species stands, the representation of species interactions in empirical forest scenario models has not received much attention so far.

The main objective of this project is to investigate methodologies for **quantifying the effects of species mixtures** on tree growth along Switzerland’s environmental gradients, and to prepare this knowledge for the use in forest scenario calculations. The project comprises of three major parts: (1) a systematic, descriptive analysis of data from the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) to provide an overview of the **frequency and the distribution of pure and mixed forests in Switzerland**; (2) quantification of **mixing effects** with nonlinear mixed-effect models fitted to NFI data and their variability with climatic, edaphic, stand and site conditions, as well as with species composition, across Switzerland’s environmental gradient; (3) identification of the different **modes of intra- and inter-specific interactions** using competition indices in Swiss mixed-species forests and their integration in growth functions.

The project  advances the understanding of the effects of species mixtures on tree growth under a broad range of environmental conditions in Switzerland. Additionally, it prepares this knowledge for further development of state-of-the-art forest scenario models, which are crucial tools for estimating potential wood supply and for supporting management decisions.

The project has been carried out by researchers at the [Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL](https://www.wsl.ch/en/index.html), Birmesdorf, Switzerland. Part of the project was developed in partnership with [INIA Madrid](http://www.inia.es/IniaPortal/verPresentacionIngles.action), Spain who hosted *Marco Mina* for a research stay in January and May 2017.  

The project has been supported by a grant from the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) under the framework of the COST Action FP1206 EuMIXFOR of the European Union.
