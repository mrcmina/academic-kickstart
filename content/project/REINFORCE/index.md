## Project overview
**REINFORCE: INtegrated landscape management for REsilient mountain FORests under global changes**

Forests are key components of modern landscapes, providing essential **ecosystem services** to humans and sustaining biodiversity. Assuring future forest resilience through sustainable management practices is one of the main priorities of the EU policy. However, forests are projected to undergo dramatic compositional and structural shifts prompted by global changes, such as intensifying natural disturbance regimes, land use and climate change, making planning for forest management exceptionally difficult. Nowadays, new interdisciplinary approaches are needed for understanding and implementing **tailored adaptation actions** to increase forest resilience to a large set of uncertainties. 

The overall aim of **REINFORCE** is to study multi-scale and **integrated forest management strategies** to enhance resilience to global changes in European mountain forest landscapes. The project aims at assessing future forest landscape dynamics in multiple case study regions in the Alps using advanced simulation modelling tools. Evaluation of resilience-based forest management adaptations follows an innovative approach combining dynamic *landscape modelling* with the principles of *functional diversity* and *network analysis*. This would allow to determine where to intervene more efficiently within forested landscapes so to maximize their resilience to sudden disturbances and climate change. Mixing multiple expertise and methods, REINFORCE also aims at filling the gap between science and local decision-makers by incorporating stakeholder community in building effective and integrated forested landscape management to cope with climate and global changes.

The project follows three main research steps:
 1. **Assessing**: evaluate future forest landscapes scenarios under uncertain global changes. 
 2. **Planning**: evaluate novel forest management plans to foster resilience to uncertain global changes. 
 3. **Reinforcing**: build integrated forest landscape management plans tailored and adapted to regional and local needs.

## Methods and study areas

We mainly work with the *individual-based forest landscape and disturbance model* [iLand](https://iland-model.org/startpage), a process-based model of the primary demographic processes in forest ecosystems (i.e. growth, mortality, and regeneration of trees). iLand simulates resource availability at the landscape scale in a spatially-explicit manner, integrating local resource competition and physiological resource use. It also integrates an *agent-based model of forest management* to dynamically address the interactions between forests and managers as coupled human and natural systems, as well as multiple *disturbance agents* (e.g., wind disturbance, bark beetle, wildfire, biotic disturbances). The model has been developed and maintained by the professorship for Ecosystem Dynamics and Forest Management at TU Munich.

We also work with the *forest stand model* [ForClim](https://ites-fe.ethz.ch/openaccess/products/forclim), a climate-sensitive forest succession (“gap”) model developed to simulate forest stand dynamics over a wide range of environmental conditions. In ForClim, establishment, growth, competition and mortality of trees are simulated on small areas (‘patches’) using only a minimum of ecological assumptions to capture the influence of climate and ecological processes on long-term forest dynamics. The model has been tested comprehensively for the representation of natural forest dynamics of temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere, with an emphasis on [European and Alpine mountain forests]({{< ref "/publication/mina_et-al_2017_JAppEco/index.md" >}}). It has been developed and maintained by the professorship for Forest Ecology at ETH Zurich.

We study forest stand and landscape dynamics in the [Eastern Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Alps), particularly those surrounding the [Trentino/South Tyrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trentino-Alto_Adige/S%C3%BCdtirol) region in Italy. As specific case studies, we focused on the Vinschgau/Venosta valley, the Stubai valley in Austria and the Val D'Ega/Val di Fiemme (upcoming!). We also selected a number of representative forest stands representaive for multiple forest types across South Tyrol, in conjunction with the specieal project [BMS-FOREST]({{< ref "/project/BMSFOREST/index.md" >}}).
