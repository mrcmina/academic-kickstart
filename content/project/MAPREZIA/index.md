## Project duration
2025 - 2027 (ongoing)


## Project overview
**MAP-Rezia: Biodiversity Monitoring in protected area of the Rezia region**

The 'MAP-Rezia' project aims to strengthen the cross-border management of biodiversity in the protected areas on the borders between Lombardy, the Province of Bolzano and the Canton of Grisons in Switzerland.
The results of the project will contribute to the development of common practices for the protection of ecosystems and will be essential for the park management bodies, researchers and policy makers involved, contributing to the conservation of biodiversity in the area and disseminating information that is crucial for raising public awareness and enhancing the territory. The project will be developed through the acquisition and harmonization of *cross-border spatial data*, the analysis of biodiversity dynamics of *large herbivore-forest relationships*, the integration of *forest modelling* in relation to future climate change scenarios, joint training and the dissemination and promotion of the work. In particular, the project foresees the implementation of four work packages (WP).

 - **WP1.** Involves acquiring and processing hyperspectral and LiDAR data to characterize and monitor the Stelvio and Swiss National Parks and the Val Monastero biosphere. This data will produce indicators to describe plant ecosystems and assess biodiversity.
 - **WP2.** Studies the dynamics of large herbivores and forest biodiversity, focusing on deer's impact on forest ecosystems and alpine grasslands. It will integrate species impact data with remote sensing and modeling of future scenarios related to population density and climate change.
 - **WP3.** Assesses forest ecosystems in relation to climate change and other factors like ungulate pressure and natural disturbances. It aims to quantify the future provision of ecosystem services through indicators.
 - **WP4.** Focuses on exchanging good practices, dissemination, and promotion activities between agencies. It will include organizing activities for both specialized audiences and the general public, and promoting a cross-border biodiversity trail.
