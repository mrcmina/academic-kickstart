abstract: The Spectral Variation Hypothesis SVH proposes that spectral heterogeneity derived from optical data can serve as a proxy for estimating biodiversity. In this study, we tested the SVH across 42 forest plots in the Italian Alps using imaging spectroscopy data from the EnMAP satellite. We investigated the relationship between SH quantified using two different metrics, Rao’s Q and the coefficient of variation CV and tree species diversity using Shannon’s H index and species richness. We applied three levels of spectral analysis: (1) SH calculated for each individual EnMAP band, 2 SH aggregated across broader spectral ranges Visible VIS, Near Infrared NIR, and Shortwave Infrared SWIR and 3 SH derived from vegetation indices.
