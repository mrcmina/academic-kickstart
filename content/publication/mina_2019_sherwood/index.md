abstract: Adverse climate change effects might compromise the future provision of crucial ecosystem services (ES) /rom European mountain forests. Using a forest dynamic model, we evaluated the future supply of ES - as we/1 as synergies and trade-offs - in case study areas of tour mountain regions under multiple management and climate change scenarios. lmpacts of climate change on the provision of ES were found to be high/y heterogeneous and to depend on the region, site and future climate. Although in some cases alternative management may be more suitable than current regimes, adaptation options must be evaluated local/y due to the highly different magnitude of the climate change impacts in different regions and along elevation gradients
