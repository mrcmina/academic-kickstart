In one of my previous posts I have already focused on the complex topic of competition among tree species. In that post I discussed the variability of species interactions (aka mixing effects) which depends on multiple environmental factors. Here I would like to enter even more into the specific. I would like to talk a bit about the “mode of competition”, in other words whether trees of different species compete more of aboveground or belowground resources.
