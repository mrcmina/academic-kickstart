Divulgative article written by Giovanni Blandino from the Communication Office of Eurac Research. In this post we discuss the vulnerability of forests in an era of global environmantal changes and how predictive models can allow to evaluate future scenarios, helping us understand how these ecosystems will behave in the face of anticipated changes such as rising temperatures and to be more prepared in their response to unexpected events.
