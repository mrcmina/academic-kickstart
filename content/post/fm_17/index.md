Insects are part of our ecosystems and are well integrated in the dynamics of our forests. However, high-intensity episodes, known as outbreaks, can have strong negative impacts on forest landscapes. In this post written with **Quim Canelles** from the Forest Sciences and Technology Centre of Catalonia (CTFC) we summarize the results of a recent review paper published in the journal *Landscape Ecology* shedding some light on the indirect effects of insect outbreaks through interactions with other forest disturbances.
