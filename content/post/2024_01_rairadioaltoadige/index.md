I was interviewed by Valentina Cibin from the regional radio streaming (RAI Alto Adige/Südtirol) about my Special Mention within the [Junior Research Award Alto Adige 2023](https://news.provincia.bz.it/it/news/lo-junior-research-award-alto-adige-2023-va-a-barbara-gross). We talked about my career but also about issues releted to forests and climate change.

The interview is in Italian. Here´s [the link to the podcast](http://www.raibz.rai.it/feed.php?id=102) and the [link of the episode with the interview, from minute 18:00](https://raibz.rai.it/streaming/Netia_Export/f0a3b308-cffc-4aa3-879e-453ae57e3b6e.mp3).
