Modelling the dynamics of Mediterranean forests at large scales is a challenge. Landscape simulation models can  help us better understand future directions of these ecosystems and how to better manage them. In this post written with PhD candidate **Maria Suarez-Mu√±oz** from the University of Granada, we summarize the results of our paper published in the journal *Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution* where we set up a ecophysiologically-based forest landscape model in a region in the Sierra Nevada mountains, southern Spain.
