I was interviewed by the network [LifeGate](https://www.lifegate.com/) about the recovery and resilience of the forests in South Tyrol hit by the windstorm Vaia. The interview was shot in Val D'Ega (Bolzano/Bozen) in the context of the [LifeGate Ioniq Climate Tour](https://www.lifegate.it/ioniq-5-lifegate-climate-tour-hyundai-resilienza)   

The article (in Italian) is published [here](https://www.lifegate.it/video/dopo-tempesta-vaia-resilienza) where we also talk about our REINFORCE project at [Eurac Research](https://www.eurac.edu/en/institutes-centers/institute-for-alpine-environment/projects/reinforce)
