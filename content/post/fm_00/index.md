When speculating on what is going to happen to our forests in an uncertain future, it is hard to generalize. Impacts on tree growth, regeneration and mortality due to climate change and other factors (e.g., forest management, disturbances) are usually quantified with scenario modelling at course, large-scale. However, given the heterogeneity of European mountain forests, the effects of climate change on ecosystem services at the local-scale seems to be highly variable. Read more what researchers from ETH ZÃ¼rich in collaboration with other European partners found.
