During the last years, scientists published a large amount of papers and books on the ecology and functioning mixed forests. This has certainly contributed to advance our understanding of how a mixed species forest work, develop, function. Many studies focused on adapting management strategies under climate change to deliver important recommendations to practitioners. But what are the main concerns of forest managers nowadays? Are they indeed worried about climate change and natural disturbance or do they just want to know how their forest will grow and when it will be ready to cut? A consortium of scientists took this time a different perspective to get answers (or better, to get questions!).
