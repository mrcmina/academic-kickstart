I was interviewed by the regional newscast RAI TGR Alto Adige about our special project on monitoring fungal diversity in South Tyrol. I briefly talked about the important role of fungi on forest ecosystems and how to monitor their diversity in forests. 

The interview (in Italian) and the short article is available at the website of [RAI Alto Adige](https://www.rainews.it/tgr/bolzano/video/2024/10/eurac-studio-biodiversita-funghi-14734f1b-749e-44a9-81e6-9186ecaaad86.html)
