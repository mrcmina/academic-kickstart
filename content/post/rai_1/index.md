I was interviewed by the Italian Public TV (RAI Alto Adige) about our project REINFORCE. I briefly talked about the importance of evaluating future forest development using models calibrated with data from field observations, and how this can deliver useful recommendations for forest management. 

The interview (in Italian) and the short article is available at the website of [RAI Alto Adige](https://www.rainews.it/tgr/bolzano/video/2021/11/blz-foreste-marco-mina-eurac-374b4110-e7ea-4c67-961a-a08a45c44233.html)
