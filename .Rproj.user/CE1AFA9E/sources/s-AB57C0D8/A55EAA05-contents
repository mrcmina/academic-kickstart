Most of the time we tend to think about forests as sources of important ecosystem service. But there is a very important service that is delivered mostly by one tree species: maple syrup. Since the early 19thcentury – and even before by Native Americans – the precious sap of Sugar maple growing only in Eastern North American forests has been tapped for producing granular sweetener and syrup. However, since the tapping season is very much depended on weather conditions, scientists have started wondering whether current production could be maintained if temperature and drought events will keep increasing in the future.
