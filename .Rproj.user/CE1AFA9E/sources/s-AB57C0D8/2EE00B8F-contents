The growth of the forest depends on a series of variables and their complex net of interactions. When the forest is composed of multiple species (called a “mixture”) its growth also depends on the intra- and inter-specific interactions between these species. Given the rising interest for biodiversity conservation, among other ecosystem services, there have been a number of growing studies on mixing effects. In this post I would like to quickly present the main results of my newly published paper on this topic.
