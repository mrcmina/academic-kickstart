## Project overview
The increasing frequency, intensity, and uncertainty of high-impact disturbance events due to global change are negatively impacting our ability to predict and manage forest growth and dynamics, therefore challenging the capacity to maintain ecological resilience and ecosystem services from forests worldwide. Forest ecosystems are complex adaptive systems, thus a multi-scale perspective and **integrated landscape management** approaches are needed to manage forests under increasing socio-ecological changes. One way to make forests more resilient to future threads is to increase functional diversity and redundancy at stand scale, and to optimize functional connectivity, centrality and modularity of forest patches in large fragmented landscapes. All this requires model-based evaluations of future landscape trajectories and a detailed analysis of the forested landscape as a **functional complex network**. This project aims at coupling **simulation modelling** with methods based on **functional diversity** and **network analysis** to determine strategic interventions at stand and landscape scale to maximize the resilience of the forests to known and unknown disturbances with the minimum effort. We work with the spatially-explicit forest landscape model [LANDIS-II](http://www.landis-ii.org/)  with the physiologically-based extension [PnET-Succession](http://www.landis-ii.org/extensions/pnet-succession) , upscaling biochemical processes (e.g., photosynthesis, transpiration) from stand (1 ha) to landscape scale (>1M ha). We model forest landscape and disturbance dynamics in Southern Quebec, testing alternative forest management strategies to increase forest resilience to changing climate and disturbance regimes.

The project follows three main research steps:
 1. to couple process-based models of stand- and landscape-scale of forest dynamics with functional diversity and network theory;
 2. to evaluate multi-scale forest management options to maintain and increase resilience under scenarios of climate and global change (incl. unexpected disturbances),
 3. to determine threshold levels of both fragmentation and functional diversity below which the overall resilience of a landscape is threatened under combinations of pulse and press disturbances.

This project will test novel and innovative ways to implement resilience-based forest management for large fragmented forest landscapes that are typical of temperate ecosystems.

The project has been financed via a career funding scheme awarded to Marco Mina by the [Swiss National Science Foundation](http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx)  (Postdoc Mobility [Grant N. 175101](http://p3.snf.ch/project-175101)) and is carried on thanks to funding by the [Canada Research Chair in Forest Resilience to Global Changes](https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/profile-eng.aspx?profileId=4449) awarded to [Christian Messier](http://www.cef-cfr.ca/index.php?n=Membres.ChristianMessier).
